# Prerequisites
You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com/)) installed on your computer. Also you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM.

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Yslamguly/ReactBackgroundGenerator`
2. Move into the repository: `cd 'reponame'`
3. Remove the current origin repository: `git remote remove origin`

### After that you can install dependencies using NPM or Yarn
#### Using NPM:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the project: `npm start`

#### Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.
1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Start the project: `yarn start`

### Once your server has started, go to this url http://localhost:3000/ to see the project locally. It should look like [here](https://yslamguly.github.io/ReactBackgroundGenerator/).
